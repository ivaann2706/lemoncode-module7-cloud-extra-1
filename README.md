# Cloud Module - Exercise 1

A heroku app is created and we deploy the app to Heroku manually using git and the Static files buildpack

This repository has two branches:

- Master: the repository code is hosted.
- heroku-branch: only the static files hosted in heroku repository

The deployed app can be found at https://lemoncode-module-cloud-extra-1.herokuapp.com/
